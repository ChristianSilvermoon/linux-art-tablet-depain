# Linux Art Tablet De-Pain

I had a very, very annoying time getting my Art Tablet to work on Linux, so, I wanted to consolidate information about how to make it happen into one place.

This repository will contain useful scripts, files, and notes that helped get certain tablet models working.

Any info I have, I'll add here
